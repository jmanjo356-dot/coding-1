# operators
# operators are a construct (built in systems) that give
# data types more actions 
# cintax means the rules of a programing language 

# Arithmetic operator family 
# Arihmatic operators are simply math operations 

print(2+4) # Addition operator
print(10-10) # Subtraction operator 
print(14.8/20) # Division operator
print(72.4+45.23) # multiplacation operator
# print is a function wherre anything writen in the round braket 

# assignment operator family
# these operators assign values to
# variables (otherwise known as containers)
# key / value

SchoolName = "Boys latin"
Age = 16
password= "OjSImpson" 
username= 77329
search = "baconator fries"


Age+=2  #addign a new value to our variable 
Age*=14  # multiplying a new value to our variable 


print(SchoolName)
print(Age)
print(username)
print(password)

print(2 > 1)
print(100 > 52)
print("123Abc" == "123Avbc") # double equal signs means 
# its comparing if the value are the same

print(2 != 3) # NOT the same
# logical operator family
# it checks and compares if certain code conditons are 
# true for false

print(3 > 1 and "Ian" == "Ian")
# the and operator checks to see Both conditions are true
# if BOTH are true the answer is True 

print(2 == 1 or 39 < 12)
# the Or operator checks if one of the conditions is true
# so long as one of the conditions is true it will ve true 

print(not(13> 10 and "joel" == "Joel")) #false
#the OR operator checks if one of the conditions is true
# the Not operator flips the results
